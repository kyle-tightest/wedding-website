# wedding-website
This is my wedding website.  
This started as a project on Bolt.  
From there I started using Gemini.
The vibe-coding is strong with this one.

## How to run
```
npm run dev
```
For some reason `vercel dev` does not work anymore and I dont know why. To test API functions, just push and let Vercel deploy and test on that branch deployment.
